Image Classification 🖼️🔍 This project builds an image classification model using both Machine Learning 🤖 and Deep Learning 🧠. It compares traditional models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) with CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify images into categories. The model is trained on a labeled dataset 📊, with data preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation 🔄 to improve performance. Results are evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics 📈. Future improvements include transfer learning 🌐 and real-time deployment 🚀.
